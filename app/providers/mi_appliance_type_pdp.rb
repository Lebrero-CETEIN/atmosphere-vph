require 'mi_resource_access'
#
# Integration with Master Interface (MI) sharing mechanism.
# Basically user can have assigned three roles for every resource
# registered using WP4 metadata mechanism: `reader`, `editor`
# and `manager`.
#
# When `reader` role is assigned to the Appliance Type than user
# is able to start new Appliance in production mode (`portal` or
# `workflow` Appliance Set type) using this type. `editor` role
# allows to start Appliance in development mode (`development`
# Appliance Set type). `manager` role allows to start new Appliance
# in both mentioned Appliance Set types.
#
# Additionally, when Appliance is started in production mode than
# `visible_to` of Appliance Type is checked and it allows to start
# Appliances created only from Appliance Type with `visible_to` set
# to `all` or `owner`.
